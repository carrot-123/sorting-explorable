      <h1>What is Sorting</h1>
      <section>
        If you've ever arranged your books by color, grouped poker cards by
        suits, or displayed your seashell collection by size, then you have
        sorted! Sorting simply refers to re-arranging elements in a certain
        order. Here's a quick example of why computers need to sort: Try finding
        and clicking on "aadvark" for both computers screens below. On which
        computer was it easier to find?

      <h1>How we Sort</h1>
      <section>
        Sorting *seems* straightforward. Try sorting the seashells below by
        clicking on two shells to swap their places. Sort from smallest to
        biggest. (They are also labeled from 1 to 6, with the smallest seashell
        labeled 1 and the biggest seashell labeled 6.)
      </section>
      <section class="sort3 box" id="sort3box1"><span>6</span></section>
      <section class="sort3 box" id="sort3box2"><span>3</span></section>
      <section class="sort3 box" id="sort3box3"><span>4</span></section>
      <section class="sort3 box" id="sort3box4"><span>5</span></section>
      <section class="sort3 box" id="sort3box5"><span>2</span></section>
      <section class="sort3 box" id="sort3box6"><span>1</span></section>
      <section>
        But for computers, sorting is not so trivial. Computers don't have eyes
        like we do, so they can't see the seashells all at once. Rather, they
        can only focus on one or two at a time. Let's now try sorting as though
        we are a computer.

      <h1>How computers sort</h1>

      <section>
        Here, you can only see two seashells at a time: the shell at the spot
        you are focusing on, and the shell in the spot after it. At any moment,
        you can swap two shells. To focus on the next shell, press "Next". If
        you reach the last spot, pressing "Next" will bring you back to first
        spot. (Hint: You'll most likely have to loop back to the first spot many
        times.) Try sorting the seashells now!

        As you can see, computers sort differently than humans! Let's explore
        three different sorting algorithms we can use to arrange our seashells.

      <h1>Bubble Sort</h1>
      <section>
        First up, it's bubble sort! The set-up is exactly the same as the
        previous sort: you can see the shell at your current spot and the shell
        at the next spot. Follow the rules (algorithm) step by step to sort all
        the seashells. (Toggle on or off )
      </section>
      <section>
        Algorithm: for as long as the seashells are not sorted, do the
        following: 1. if the shell at your current spot is bigger than the shell
        at the next spot, then swap them 2. Move to the next shell
